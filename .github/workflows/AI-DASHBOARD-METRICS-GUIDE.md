# 🤖 AI Dashboard Metrics Guide

**A comprehensive guide to understanding AI code analysis metrics for stakeholders**

---

## 📋 Overview

The AI Dashboard tracks two key metrics that measure different aspects of AI code usage in your development process. Understanding the difference between these metrics is crucial for making informed decisions about AI adoption and code quality.

## 📊 The Two Key Metrics

### 📈 **Average AI Code**
> *"What percentage of AI does a typical pull request contain?"*

**Business Meaning:** Shows the average AI usage pattern across your development team  
**Technical Definition:** The arithmetic mean of AI percentages across all pull requests  
**Calculation:** `(PR1% + PR2% + PR3% + ...) ÷ Number of PRs`

### 🎯 **Overall AI Percentage** 
> *"What percentage of your total code changes are AI-generated?"*

**Business Meaning:** Shows the actual volume impact of AI on your codebase  
**Technical Definition:** Character-weighted percentage of AI content  
**Calculation:** `(Total AI Characters ÷ Total Characters) × 100`

---

## 🔍 Real-World Example

Consider a development team with 3 recent pull requests:

| PR # | Description | AI Characters | Total Characters | AI Percentage |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| #101 | Bug fix | 50 | 500 | 10% |
| #102 | Small feature | 450 | 500 | 90% |
| #103 | Major refactor | 100 | 10,000 | 1% |

### 📈 Average AI Code Calculation:
```
(10% + 90% + 1%) ÷ 3 PRs = 33.7%
```
**Interpretation:** "The average pull request contains 33.7% AI-generated code"

### 🎯 Overall AI Percentage Calculation:
```
(50 + 450 + 100) ÷ (500 + 500 + 10,000) × 100 = 5.5%
```
**Interpretation:** "5.5% of all code changes are AI-generated"

## 🤔 Why Are They Different?

The metrics serve different purposes and can tell very different stories:

### **Average AI Code** (33.7% in example)
- ✅ **Treats each PR equally** - small and large PRs have same weight
- 📊 **Developer behavior focus** - shows typical AI usage patterns
- 🎯 **Team adoption metric** - indicates how frequently developers use AI

### **Overall AI Percentage** (5.5% in example)
- ✅ **Weighs by code volume** - larger PRs have more influence
- 📊 **Business impact focus** - shows actual codebase changes
- 🎯 **Risk assessment metric** - indicates real AI code volume

## 📚 Stakeholder Decision Matrix

| Question | Use This Metric | Why |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| "Are developers adopting AI tools?" | **Average AI Code** | Shows usage frequency across team |
| "How much AI code are we actually shipping?" | **Overall AI Percentage** | Shows real volume impact |
| "Should we provide AI training?" | **Average AI Code** | Indicates team adoption patterns |
| "What's our AI code risk exposure?" | **Overall AI Percentage** | Shows actual AI content volume |
| "Are small vs large features using AI differently?" | **Compare both metrics** | Gap indicates usage patterns |

---

## 📈 Interpretation Guidelines

### **High Average, Low Overall** (33.7% vs 5.5%)
```
✅ Frequent AI usage in small changes
⚠️ Large features still mostly manual
💡 Action: Encourage AI use in larger features
```

### **Low Average, High Overall** (15% vs 45%)
```
⚠️ Few developers using AI heavily
✅ When used, AI makes big impact
💡 Action: Broader AI adoption training
```

### **Both High** (85% vs 80%)
```
✅ Widespread AI adoption
✅ Significant codebase impact
💡 Action: Focus on AI code quality
```

### **Both Low** (5% vs 3%)
```
⚠️ Limited AI adoption
⚠️ Minimal impact on development
💡 Action: Investigate adoption barriers
```

## 📞 Questions & Support

### **Common Questions**

**Q: Why is Average AI Code higher than Overall AI Percentage?**  
A: Your team frequently uses AI for small changes but manually codes large features.

**Q: Should we aim for 100% AI code?**  
A: Not necessarily. Focus on appropriate AI use and maintaining code quality.

**Q: How often is this data updated?**  
A: The dashboard updates automatically when pull requests are merged.
